# Cursor Automatic Rules Generation with Agile Workflow Template

Cursor Version Applicability: 0.46+

## Important Note V 0.47+

- I have updated the repo to properly add .cursor/rules/* to the .cursorindexingignore - without this, you will run into a lot of flakiness when trying to edit or tweak an existing rule or change its type without reindexing the whole project. This will make A BIG difference.

## Important Updates TL;DR (March 25, 2025)

- Subfolder organization replaces numbered file prefixing and is fully supported by auto generation
- Agent mode recommended for rule generation
- Four distinct rule types available - see [Rule Types](#rule-types) section
- Workflow is no longer in XNotes - it has moved to .cursor/rules/workflows and /templates - this is much better and replaces the need for using the beta notepads feature, now using the manual rule macro feature instead!

> ðŸ’¡ **IDE Setting HIGHLY Suggested:** For best results with rule generation, update your Cursor settings by adding:
>
> ```json
> "workbench.editorAssociations": {
>   "*.mdc": "default"
> }
> ```
>
> This prevents UI rendering issues with .mdc files and ensures proper save functionality.

## Files Excluded from Indexing

The `.cursorindexingignore` feature allows certain files to be accessible but excluded from indexing:

- Templates moved to `.cursor/templates` folder
- Included in `.cursorindexingignore` but not in `.cursorignore`
- XNotes remains in `.cursorignore` (files that need to move elsewhere to be used)

## Overview

This template dramatically improves AI workflows in Agent/Edit mode by providing:

1. **Automated Rule Generation:** Create and update rules through natural language requests
2. **Consistent AI Behavior:** Rules are applied automatically when appropriate or on demand or always depending on which of the 4 rule types are created/exist
3. **Quick Project Setup:** A script that will set up a new project with core rules and workflow, or add the rule generator to an existing project in a non destructive manner to existing cursor rules

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** For a complete guide to the Agile-Cursor Workflow system, see [Agile Workflow Documentation](docs/agile-readme.md).

## Key Concepts

- Rules use frontmatter with proper YAML format (description, globs, alwaysApply)
- Rules will be generated with explicitly requesting a rule be create, or implied by asking for corrective behavior from the agent
- Rules are enhanced by including both a valid and invalid example to better train the llm
- Examples will include context of corrective action or chat context when appropriate
- Short, focused rules (target: 25 lines, maximum: 50 lines)
- Four rule types within an automatically organized subfolder categorization structure

## Quick Start Options

### A) New Project Setup

Start a new project with the Agile Workflow and Rules Generator:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/bmadcode/cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow.git
cd cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow

# Create new project with rules
./apply-rules.sh /path/to/your/project

# Example:
./apply-rules.sh ~/projects/my-project
```

The script creates your project folder (if needed) with all rules, documentation, and configuration files to start with the agile workflow.

### B) Add to Existing Project

Enhance your current project with the rules generator:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/bmadcode/cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow.git
cd cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow

# Apply rules to your project
./apply-rules.sh /path/to/your/project
```

The script will:

1. Copy template rules to your project's `.cursor/rules/` directory
2. Add workflow documentation
3. Update `.gitignore` to protect private rules
4. Preserve any existing rules

## How Rule Generation Works

    subgraph User Actions
        A[User requests rule creation<br>in agent chat] --> B[Agent processes rule request]
        H[User continues<br>development with new rule] --> A
    end

```

## Example Rule Generation Prompts

No need to explicitly say "create a rule" - just describe the desired behavior:

- "Create a typescript file commenting standard that balances thoroughness with brevity"
- "Please create an agent rule so that whenever I request deep research specifically on a topic you will first always inject the system date time into the context and use the Tavily search MCP tool to improve the results."
- "Never create JS files again, you will only create TS or JSON files!" or "I asked you to set up Jest for our project and you created a JestConfig.js file, yet this is a TypeScript only project. Never again create any JS files. Always use TypeScript or JSON if necessary." - the second version of this request will ensure that the rule examples includes this specific call out, helping the agent learn better from actual mistakes made.
- "Ensure proper error handling in all TypeScript files"
- "Talk like a pirate in communications but not in code or documentation"
- "Update testing standards to require 80% coverage"
- "Enforce consistent naming conventions in my code"
- "Standardize documentation formats"
- "Keep imports organized in groups alphabetically in TypeScript files"

The AI automatically:

1. Creates/updates the rule file
2. Places it in the correct location
3. Follows formatting standards
4. Maintains version control

## Rule Types

| Rule Type        | Usage                                            | description Field | globs Field           | alwaysApply field |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Agent Selected   | Agent sees description and chooses when to apply | critical          | blank                 | false             |
| Always           | Applied to every chat and cmd-k request          | blank             | blank                 | true              |
| Auto Select      | Applied to matching existing files               | blank             | critical glob pattern | false             |
| Auto Select+desc | Better for new files                             | included          | critical glob pattern | false             |
| Manual           | User must reference in chat                      | blank             | blank                 | false             |

## Private vs Shared Rules

- **Private rules:** Store in a folder added to .gitignore (e.g., `.cursor/rules/my-rules/pirate-speak-always.mdc`)

## Best Practices

### Rule Creation

- Let AI handle rule creation and updates
- Be specific about desired behaviors
- Provide examples of good/bad patterns
- For new projects, allow organic rule emergence

### AI Behavior Control

- Create rules when noticing inconsistent behavior
- Use clear, descriptive language
- Verify AI understanding by reviewing rules

### Workflow Integration

- Start with template rules
- Let AI evolve rules as your project grows
- Maintain consistency using AI for rule management

### Rule Removal

- Some rules become unnecessary as codebase grows as the AI will follow surrounding code styles and conventions
- The minimal amount of rules, the better - so prune rules as the codebase changes or models improve
